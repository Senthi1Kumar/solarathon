        The **Sleep Health** app is designed to improve sleep health and overall well-being by providing users with personalized insights and recommendations.
        Its purpose is to track and analyze sleep data using the [**OURA Ring**](https://ouraring.com/) API, a wearable device that captures sleep-related metrics such as sleep duration, sleep stages, and sleep quality.
        
        The target audience for the app includes individuals who are interested in optimizing their sleep and want to gain a better understanding of their sleep patterns.
        This may include people experiencing sleep-related issues, athletes looking to improve their recovery, or anyone who wants to prioritize their sleep for better health and performance.
